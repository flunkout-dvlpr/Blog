&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd like to think that Iâ€™ve gotten a good grip on the basics and a lot more comfortable with learning new things regarding my field of work. The gain in confidence has made it easier to intensely focus on further developing my skills/career and taking on any possible opportunity associated with it. As a result, this has also helped other aspects of my life that, at least in my opinion, directly impact the ability to achieve said meaningful progress. Such as, putting routines in place to take care of daily/weekly/monthly tasks that would otherwise get in the way. Taking my health and fitness more serious by consistently meal prepping and working out. And overall trying to  stay aware of what pushes me forward and what weighs me down.

While in the 'grove' of it all, you really get a kick out of it!, 
> Iâ€™ll wake up before my alarm even rings \\
> Pack my meal prep \\
> Zoom to the gym \\
> Push a bit more on the day's workout \\
> Create new scripts at work, come up with cool new features \\
> Head out the office and rush to whatever project/side gig I currently got going on and well code code code \\
> Throughout the whole day thereâ€™s a sense of \\
> Of invincibility \\
> Of control \\
> Of power.

The issue however, the reason for writing up this post is that, well it doesnâ€™t seem to be IT.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By no means have I mastered any of the aspects I just explained, and the process is definitely fulfilling and rewarding. But I get a sense that it's not sustainable, at least not with the mentality and manner that Iâ€™m approaching it.

When trying to come up with the underlying reason as to why Iâ€™m pursuing all of it, I come up with the following, 
> ### It can create financial securityðŸ’°
> ### It brings me joy while doing it ðŸ˜Ž
> ### Improving my skills can open the door to more opportunities!ðŸ¤“
> ### Recognition and accreditation

And while these are all valid reasons, although some more superficial than others, 
It some what points out my issue, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Theyâ€™re all tied to the possible success from furthering my career which isn't set in stone nor 100% guaranteed. Iâ€™ve deeply associated my happiness to something that, although plays a huge role in my life, is external nonetheless. In moments of frustration/fear focusing on 'furthering my career' can be extremely hard and more importantly, feeling happy or simply at peace becomes impossible, because like I mentioned Iâ€™ve tied my happiness to it. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess I write this just to say, Iâ€™ve got to learn to be happy with just being me, and work on the things thatâ€™ll allow me to be happy while just being me!, whatever that is. Not saying that I don't want to code anymore but I don't want to feel guilty whenever I'm not, I need to find that balance and realign my perspective. As with any relationship, the join of the two create a greater sum but arenâ€™t codependent, kind of like a Relational Database each table has valuable information and when joined it creates an abundance of information(had to throw some code talk in there)ðŸ˜…ðŸ’€ 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This post wonâ€™t directly solve anything but at least for me, whenever I get a sense that things donâ€™t feel quite right, taking some time to write down and collect my thoughts(or my best attempt at it) is the first step in acknowledging and figuring out what to do about it. We all have issues were dealing with whether big or small, they're very real to us, and at times they can seem daunting to deal with, but don't fear them embrace them, the best comes from them.

ps. I think the funniest thing of all of this is that I actually had to code in order to publish this post which is the thing that I'm complaining about on some YingYang/Come Full Circle type shit haha!
