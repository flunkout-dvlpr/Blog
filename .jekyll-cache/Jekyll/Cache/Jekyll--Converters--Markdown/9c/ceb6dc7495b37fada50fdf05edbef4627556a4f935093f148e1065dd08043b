<p><strong>Today’s Progress</strong>: Ok, starting from scratch, I’ve been on and off haven’t really kept up. I am going to continue with The Self Taught Programmer book along with working on the Membership_Recipe webApp. I am on the 6th chapter of the book but I’ll start counting the progress from today.</p>

<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong>:A while ago I got a gh-pages blog up but never got to posting stuff, seems like now would be a good time to revisit that and I’m hoping it will also help me stay a bit more committed(to make more commits on github haha)</p>
