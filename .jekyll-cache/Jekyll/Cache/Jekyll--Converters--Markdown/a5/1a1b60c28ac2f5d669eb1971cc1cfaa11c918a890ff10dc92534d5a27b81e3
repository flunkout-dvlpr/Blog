<p>I just finished watching the Decoding Bill Gates  series and it really kinda fucked me up, in a good way</p>

<p>Recently a lot of things have gone pretty well for me. Or so I like to think, especially when compared to where I was and how I felt just a couple of years ago.</p>

<p>After graduating HS, I went on to attend Texas A&amp;M, and that‚Äôs around the time frame I like to consider the start of my ‚Äújourney‚Äù when I became conscious of my self if you will</p>

<p>I arrived to college station with a whole lot of arrogance/ignorance. I had this mindset that I had picked one of the best schools in the state(or at least the best one I could manage to get into) And there for I had been granted a secured path to success, all I had to do was get that diploma.</p>

<p>It quickly became clear to me that i was not as smart as thought I was. And began to understand why it was turning out to be more challenging than I had expected. For so long I had focused on one thing, meeting the qualifications to be considered smart but never really focused on the process of acquiring, retaining or much less synthesizing knowledge.
This had been much easier to pull off before for several factors the circumstances/requirements/standards that come along with the public education system</p>

<p>Essentially I was a phony, coming to sense with this (or at least trying to)profoundly shook things up, followed up with a bit of depression/escapism/being a first generation student and a couple of bad habits thrown in the mix made the perfect recipe for the rocky road that was to come the following years. 
It all eventually caught up to me and by the end of the fall semester of junior year, I was under appeal review by the CS Department to retain my spot. The appeal was denied and I was given no other choice but to choose another major and move on. Looking back it‚Äôs clear that there was really no other outcome considering the way I was managing myself at the time but nonetheless I was devastated.</p>

<p>And so I decided to drop out and drop in. Initially it really felt like my whole world had crumbled, since a little kid my parents had instilled in me that graduating form college was the ultimate goal. knowing that they had sacrificed so much to get me up to this point</p>

<p>I say all of this to state that 
I need to do more work, work harder and focus on the big picture while being able to continuously connect the smaller dots to get there. I need to stop getting excited about the wins, I deep inside already knew I could win but may have made harder to achieve through poor choices. To focus more on the things I haven‚Äôt yet thought about and how I will make them happen. To embrace the actual/bigger challenges ahead of me and BE MORE FEARLESS</p>
